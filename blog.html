    <h3> February 12, 2020</h3>
    <p> Today we arrived at our classroom and noticed that there was no teacher inside... <br/>
        MR. MADDEN WASN'T THERE!!!!!!!! <br/>
        We waited...<br/>
        and waited...<br/>
        and still no sign of our advisor... <br/>
        Last week it was the freshman <br/>
        This week it was our own teacher! <br/>
        We left a note on the door<br/>
        ...with AJ's horrible handwriting <br/>
        ...and with no other choice... <br/>
        retreated to upper cafe...
        <br/><br/>
        In other news, we are planning a bake sale so the GWC organization can't take our money away. <br/>
        Secret weapon... <br/>
        <div class = secretweapon>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOFT PRETZELS <br/>
        </div>
        We are thinking of changing our signature. The options are: <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Git it Girls</li>
            <li>Garbage Out, Girls </li>
            <li> GUI Girls </li>
            <li> Giga Girls</li>
        </ul>
        AJ was sprouting grey hairs by the second as she tried to understand grids in CSS <br/>

        <h3> February 19th, 2020</h3>
        <p> Today at the beginning of class, we were comparing our heights and came to the conclusion that Riley is a giant! <br/>
        Also, AJ is faking her height by wearing platform shoes and putting inserts in her shoes (it adds an extra three feet so her actual height is two feet). <br/>
            Then we began working on our website. <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Sarah and Riley give salutations. They are working on the project tab trying to add little templates for the entries.</li>
                <li> UPDATE! SARAH AND RILEY FINISHED THE TEMPLATE üòÅüòÇüòÑ</li>
                <li> AJ and Nida say hello and how are you. AJ has the hiccups. AJ claims she is five foot three.</li>
                <li> Nida got a beautiful haircut last week. She claims AJ is an elf on the shelf that is watching us code (making sure we are right)</li>
                <li> AJ and Nida are working on the About Me page for the Website. They made classes for each of us!</li>
            </ul>
            We came up with a few more new names:
            <ul>
                <li> CS Chicks </li>
                <li> Binary Babes </li>
                <li> Scripting Sisters </li>
                <li> Data Divas </li>
            </ul>
            We took a poll and...... <br/>
             <br/>

    <p> WE GOT OUR MONEY!!!! jk. <br/>
        WE GOT THE T-SHIRTS!!! <br/>
    They were personally escorted from the main office to the room by six people <br/>
    Its like when the president drives and there's like nine cars <br/>
    They are all different sizes and styles...<br/>
        One of them is a child's size 6-8. Alyssa is currently wearing that. <br/>
        Some have "who" on the back, or on the sleeve... or none at all... <br/>
        Its like if GWC and WHO had a collaboration: GWC x WHO = GIRLS CODE (WHO) <br/>
